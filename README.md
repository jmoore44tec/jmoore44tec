- 👋 Hi, I’m @jmoore44tec
- 👀 I’m interested in music, coding, video games and anime!
- 🌱 I’m currently attending SNHU for a BS in Computer Science with a focus on Software Development.
- 🧑🏾‍💼 Professional Work: web-design, HTML (Website for a music artist with continuous updates) ( https://clevertribe.neocities.org/CT%20site )
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on various projects. I currently have a decent handle on C++, Java, HTML, and some Python as well!
- 📫 Reach Me: jmoore13tec@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have many years of experience in music production and audio engineering as well!

- Many of my personal projects are in the form of txt files as I am not on my own PC. I compiled each file using online compilers for C++ and Java.

- Because I am still new to coding, I do not have very crazy ideas for projects. Most of my personal work takes the form of games as I enjoy exploring ways to make coding more fun.
- So far I am working on:
+ C++ gaming engine - Arcade Shooter (Mech vs Alien game)
+ C++ Text-Based Adventure RPG
+ HTML5 Text-Based Adventure RPG
+ Java Triple Pack (Includes 21, Matching Game, and Guess Who?)
